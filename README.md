# Lorem

Virtual learning can be a very isolating experience, leaving students with no way to meet or study with new classmates.
Lorem is a mobile application for college students to connect with their classmates during online semesters. It allows the user to sign in with their school, select one of their courses, and be matched with fellow classmates according to their personal preferences. Users can then view the profiles of their matches and initiate a conversation with them.
Lorem is compatible with both iOS and Android systems.

1. Clone repository and open in Visual Studio Code.
2. Run "npm start" in the terminal.
